　　Part B 

　　Directions: 

　　Read the following text and answer the questions by choosing the most suitable subheading from the 
 list A-G for each of the numbered paragraphs(41-45).There are two extra subheadings which you do not 
 need to use.Mark your answers on the ANSWER SHEET. 

　　[A]Be silly 

　　[B]Have fun 

　　[C]Express your emotions 

　　[D]Don't overthink it 

　　[E]Be easily pleased 

　　[F]Notice things 

　　[G]Ask for help 

　　As adults,it seems that we are constantly pursuing happiness,often with mixed results.Yet children 
 appear to have it down to an art-and for the most part they don't need self-help books or therapy.instead,they 
 look after their wellbeing instinctively,and usually more effectively than we do as grownups.Perhaps 
 it's time to learn a few lessons from them. 

　　41.______________ 

　　What does a child do when he's sad? He cries.When he's angry?He shouts.Scared?Probably a bit of both.As 
 we grow up,we learn to control our emotions so they are manageable and don't dictate our behaviours,which 
 is in many ways a good thing.But too often we take this process too far and end up suppressing 
 emotions,especially negative ones.that's about as effective as brushing dirt under a carpet 
 and can even make us ill.What we need to do is find a way to acknowledge and express what we feel 
 appropriately, and then-again like children-move. 

　　42.____________ 

　　A couple of Christmases ago, my youngest stepdaughter, who was nine years old at the time, got a Superman 
 T-shirt for Christmas. It cost less than a fiver but she was overjoyed, and couldn't stop talking 
 about it.Too often we believe that a new job,bigger house or better car will be the magic silver 
 bullet that will allow us to finally be content,but the reality is these things have very little 
 lasting impact on our happiness levels. Instead, being grateful for small things every day is 
 a much better way to improve wellbeing. 

　　43.______________________ 

　　Have you ever noticed how much children laugh? If we adults could indulge in a bit of silliness and 
 giggling, we would reduce the stress hormones in our bodies , increase good hormones like endorphins, 
 improve blood flow to our hearts and even have a greater chance of fighting off enfection. All 
 of which, of course, have a positive effect on happiness levels. 

　　44.__________________ 

　　The problem with being a grown up is that there's an awful lot of serious stuff to deal with---work,mortgage 
 payments,figuring out what to cook for dinner. But as adults we also have the luxury of 
 being able to control our own diaries and it's important that we schedule in time to enjoy the things 
 we love.Those things might be social,sporting,creative or completely random(dancing aroud the 
 living room,anyone?)--it doesn't matter,so long as they're enjoyable, and not likely to have negative 
 side effects,such as drinking too much alcohol or going on a wild spending spree if you're on 
 a tight budget. 

　　45.___________________ 

　　Having said all of the above, it's important to add that we shouldn't try too hard to be happy.Scientists 
 tell us this can backfire and actually have a negative impact on our wellbeing. As the Chinese 
 philosopher Chuang Tzu is reported to have said:"Happiness is the absence of striving for happiness."And 
 in that,once more,we need to look to the example of our children,to whom happiness is not 
 a goal but a natural by product of the way they live. 

　　意料之中的小标题。首先明确7个选项的意思。 

　　首先应当把握本文的出发点，也就是41题目之前的关键句：我们应该从孩子身上学习一些东西。“捉住本中心，每个标题都是提醒成人可以从孩子身上得到一些启示。 

　　41. C 表达情感。开头以问句的方式：“孩子悲伤时会怎样？孩子生气时会如何？他们的表达方式与大人不同，成人更多会选择压抑情感，并且会有不好的后果，比如致病。紧接着最后一句算是总结句：我们要找到一种合适的方式表达，像孩子那样。重点在哪里？整段不离的中心意思，重复的出现那就是情感的表达喽。选项为 
 C 

　　42.E举例子的目的无非是为了证明观点。但是从例子也是可以总结出想要表达的意思的。讲到一个小女孩因为一个廉价的圣诞礼物就可以高兴，并且很快乐，就旨在讲小小的幸福。再来看看例子后面的观点。提到成人的世界里所谓的车啊，房啊之类的貌似会让我们 
 幸福的东西其实不然。所以一个instead 直接把本段的中心意思表达了出来，那就是幸福来自于小小的事情。对应选项E 

　　43. A 一句话出现在第二句。问句之后，如果我们能够“愚蠢“那么一点点，我们将会有各种好处，对不对。那么这一段几乎大段的篇幅都花在这一句上了，主旨更加明显那就是：去这样做吧。Be silly. 

　　44.B 这一段讲到成人的世界里的确有太多让人烦恼的东西，But as adults we also have the luxury of being able to control our own 
 diaries and it's important that we schedule in time to enjoy the things we love 享受自己喜欢的东西也是很重要的。接下来举例子，各种具体事例说明那些我们可以做的可以享受的事情，并且最后说出了他们的好处。从前往后一直再说我们应该放松，享受。所以啊，在剩下的可选择的选项中只有have 
 funs比较合适了。 

　　45.D 不要可以去想怎样才幸福，应用了哲人的一句话来说明这个道理，旨在告诉大家当让是过程就是幸福的了。最后可以用排除法。G寻求帮助根本未提及。F 选项可以直接排除。那么对应关系，来看看D 不要想太多。“无欲无求，本就是幸福啦。“最终选定D。
