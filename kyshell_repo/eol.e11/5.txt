　　Will the European Union make it? The question would have sounded strange not long ago. Now even the 
 project's greatest cheerleader's talk of a continent facing a "Bermuda triangle" of debt, population 
 decline and lower growth. 

　　As well as those chronic problems, the EU faces an acute crisis in its economic core, the 16 countries 
 that use the single currency. Markets have lost faith that the euro zone's economies, weaker or 
 stronger, will one day converge thanks to the discipline of sharing a single currency, which denies 
 uncompetitive members the quick fix of devaluation. 

　　Yet the debate about how to save Europe's single currency from disintegration is stuck. It is stuck 
 because the euro zone's dominant powers, France and Germany, agree on the need for greater harmonization 
 within the euro zone, but disagree about what to harmonies. 

　　Germany thinks the euro must be saved by stricter rules on borrow spending and competitiveness, barked 
 by quasi-automatic sanctions for governments that do not obey. These might include threats to 
 freeze EU funds for poorer regions and EU mega-projects and even the suspension of a country's voting 
 rights in EU ministerial councils. It insists that economic co-ordination should involve all 27 
 members of the EU club, among whom there is a small majority for free-market liberalism and economic 
 rigors; in the inner core alone, Germany fears, a small majority favour French interference. 
 

　　A "southern" camp headed by French wants something different:"European economic government" within 
 an inner core of euro-zone members. Translated, that means politicians intervening in monetary policy 
 and a system of redistribution from richer to poorer members, via cheaper borrowing for governments 
 through common Eurobonds or complete fiscal transfers. Finally, figures close to the France 
 government have murmured, euro-zone members should agree to some fiscal and social harmonization: 
 e.g., curbing competition in corporate-tax rates or labour costs. 

　　It is too soon to write off the EU. It remains the world's largest trading block. At its best, the 
 European project is remarkably liberal: built around a single market of 27 rich and poor countries, 
 its internal borders are far more open to goods, capital and labour than any comparable trading 
 area. It is an ambitious attempt to blunt the sharpest edges of globalization, and make capitalism 
 benign.
