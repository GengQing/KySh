　　Text 3 

　　We tend to think of the decades immediately following World War II as a time of prosperity and growth, 
 with soldiers returning home by the millions, going off to college on the G. I. Bill and lining 
 up at the marriage bureaus. 

　　But when it came to their houses, it was a time of common sense and a belief that less could truly 
 be more. During the Depression and the war, Americans had learned to live with less, and that restraint, 
 in combination with the postwar confidence in the future, made small, efficient housing positively 
 stylish. 

　　Economic condition was only a stimulus for the trend toward efficient living. The phrase "less is more" 
 was actually first popularized by a German, the architect Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, who like 
 other people associated with the Bauhaus, a school of design, emigrated to the United States before 
 World War II 

　　and took up posts at American architecture schools. These designers came to exert enormous influence 
 on the course of American architecture, but none more so that Mies. 

　　Mies's signature phrase means that less decoration, properly organized, has more impact that a lot. 
 Elegance, he believed, did not derive from abundance. Like other modern architects, he employed metal, 
 glass and laminated wood-materials that we take for granted today buy that in the 1940s symbolized 
 the future. Mies's sophisticated presentation masked the fact that the spaces he designed were 
 small and efficient, rather than big and often empty. 

　　The apartments in the elegant towers Mies built on Chicago's Lake Shore Drive, for example, were smaller-two-bedroom 
 units under 1,000 square feet-than those in their older neighbors along the city's 
 Gold Coast. But they were popular because of their airy glass walls, the views they afforded and 
 the elegance of the buildings' details and proportions, the architectural equivalent of the abstract 
 art so popular at the time. 

　　The trend toward "less" was not entirely foreign. In the 1930s Frank Lloyd Wright started building 
 more modest and efficient houses-usually around 1,200 square feet-than the spreading two-story ones 
 he had designed in the 1890s and the early 20th century. 

　　The "Case Study Houses" commissioned from talented modern architects by California Arts & Architecture 
 magazine between 1945 and 1962 were yet another homegrown influence on the "less is more" trend. 
 Aesthetic effect came from the landscape, new materials and forthright detailing. In his Case Study 
 House, Ralph everyday life - few American families acquired helicopters, though most eventually 
 got clothes dryers - but his belief that self-sufficiency was both desirable and inevitable was 
 widely shared.
