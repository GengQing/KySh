The
outbreak
of
swine
flu
that
was
first
detected
in
Mexico
was
declared
a
global
epidemic
on
June
11,
2009.
It
is
the
first
worldwide
epidemic
1
by
the
World
Health
Organization
in
41
years.
The
heightened
alert
2
an
emergency
meeting
with
flu
experts
in
Geneva
that
assembled
after
a
sharp
rise
in
cases
in
Australia,
and
rising
3
in
Britain,
Japan,
Chile
and
elsewhere.
But
the
epidemic
is
"
4
"
in
severity,
according
to
Margaret
Chan,
the
organization's
director
general,
5
the
overwhelming
majority
of
patients
experiencing
only
mild
symptoms
and
a
full
recovery,
often
in
the
6
of
any
medical
treatment.
The
outbreak
came
to
global
7
in
late
April
2009,
when
Mexican
authorities
noted
an
unusually
large
number
of
hospitalizations
and
deaths
8
healthy
adults.
As
much
of
Mexico
City
shut
down
at
the
height
of
a
panic,
cases
began
to
9
in
New
York
City,
the
southwestern
United
States
and
around
the
world.
In
the
United
States,
new
cases
seemed
to
fade
10
warmer
weather
arrived.
But
in
late
September
2009,
officials
reported
there
was
11
flu
activity
in
almost
every
state
and
that
virtually
all
the
12
tested
are
the
new
swine
flu,
also
known
as
(A)
H1N1,
not
seasonal
flu.
In
the
U.
S.,
it
has
13
more
than
one
million
people,
and
caused
more
than
600
deaths
and
more
than
6,000
hospitalizations.
Federal
health
officials
14
Tamiflu
for
children
from
the
national
stockpile
and
began
15
orders
from
the
states
for
the
new
swine
flu
vaccine.
The
new
vaccine,
which
is
different
from
the
annual
flu
vaccine,
is
16
ahead
of
expectations.
More
than
three
million
doses
were
to
be
made
available
in
early
October
2009,
though
most
of
those
17
doses
were
of
the
FluMist
nasal
spray
type,
which
is
not
18
for
pregnant
women,
people
over
50
or
those
with
breathing
difficulties,
heart
disease
or
several
other
19
.
But
it
was
still
possible
to
vaccinate
people
in
other
high-risk
groups:
health
care
workers,
people
20
infants
and
healthy
young
people.
