Text 2
A century ago, the immigrants from across the Atlantic included settlers and
sojourners. Along with the many folks looking to make a permanent home in the
United States came those who had no intention to stay, and 7millin people arrived
while
about2
million
departed.
Abouta
quarter
of
all
Italian
immigrants,
for
example,
eventually
returned
to
Italy
for
good.
They
even
had
an
affectionate
nickname, “uccelli di passaggio,” birds of passage.
Today, we are much more rigid about immigrants. We divide newcomers into
two
categories:
legal
or
illegal,
good
or
bad.
We
hail
them
as
Americans
in
the
making,
or
our
broken
immigration
system
and
the
long
political
paralysis
over
how to fix it. We don’t need more categories, but we
need to change the way we
think
about
categories.
We
need
to
look
beyond
strict
definitions
of
legal
and
illegal.
To
start,
we
can
recognize
the
new
birds
of
passage,
those
living
and
thriving
in
the
gray
areas.
We
might
then
begin
to
solve
our
immigration
challenges.
