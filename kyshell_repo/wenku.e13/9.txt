The hugely popular blog the Skint Foodie chronicles how Tony balances his
love of good food with living on benefits. After bills, Tony has £60 a week to spend,
£40
of
which
goes
on
food,
but

he's
living
ina
council
flat
and
fielding
offers
from
literary
agents.

about
eating
as

as

"there are so many people in a much worse state, with barely any money to spend
on food" - but eating well on a budget. Here's his advice for economical foodies.

[B] Balance your diet
[C] Shopkeepers are your friends
[D] Remember to treat yourself
[E] Stick to what you need
[F] Planning is everything
[G] Waste not, want not
