　　“Suatainability” has become apopular word these days, but to Ted Ning, the concept will always have 
 personal meaning. Having endured apainful period of unsustainability in his own life made itclear 
 to him that sustainability-oriented values must be expressed though everyday action and choice. 

　　Ning recalls spending aconfusing year in the late 1990s selling insurance. He’d been though the dot-com 
 boom and burst and,desperate for ajob,signed on with a Boulder agency. 

　　It didin’t go well. “It was a really had move because that’s not my passion,” says Ning, whose dilemma 
 about the job translated, predictably, into a lack of sales. “I was miserable, I had so much anxiety 
 that I would wake up in the middle of the night and stare at the ceiling. I had no money and 
 needed the job. Everyone said, ‘Just wait, you’ll trun the corner, give it some time.’”
