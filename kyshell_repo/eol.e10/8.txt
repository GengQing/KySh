　　最近，“承受力”成了一个流行词，但对Ted Ning来说，他对其含义有自己亲身的体会。在经历了一段无法承受的痛苦生活后，他清楚的认识到，旨在提高承受力的价值观只有通过每日的行为和抉择才能得到体现。 
 

　　Ning回忆起九十年代后期销售保险那困惑的一年。在经历了网络泡沫的膨胀和破灭后，他急需找到一份工作，因此就与Boulder公司签了约。 

　　但情况并不顺利。“这的确是糟糕的一步，因为它激不起我的工作热情，”Ning说。不出所料，工作上的进退维谷造成他销售业绩不佳。“我很痛苦，愁肠百结，常常在半夜惊醒，望着天花板发愣。我身无分文，需要这份工作。大家都说，‘等等看，过一段时间情况会好转的。’”

　　Part A 

　　Dear xxx, 

　　I would like to convey my heartfelt thanks to you for your kindness to receive me when I participated 
 in an exchange program in USA. 

　　Your generous help made it possible that I had a very pleasant stay and a chance to know American cultures 
 better. Besides, I think it is an honor for me to make friends with you and I will cherish 
 the goodwill you showed to me wherever I go. I do hope that you will visit China one day, so that 
 I could have the opportunity to repay your kindness and refresh our friendship. 

　　I feel obliged to thank you again. 

　　Sincerely yours, 

　　Zhang Wei 

　　Part B 

　　In this chart, we can see the mobile phone subscriptions in developed countries have a steady and slight 
 increase from 1990 to 2007 and then remain constant in 2008. Meanwhile the mobile phone subscriptions 
 in developing countries have witnessed a slow increase from 1990 to 2004 and then a great 
 surge from 2004 to 20007: the biggest surge happens from 2005 to 2006. 

　　This chart reflects different developing modes of mobile phone industry in developed and developing 
 countries. The developed countries have a limited number of populations, most of whom are well-educated. 
 Therefore, the spreading of the mobile phone service is efficient and soon the market is saturated. 
 Also at the beginning the developed countries have more people who can afford this service. 
 The developing countries have a large population who keeps a large demand for mobile service. 
 As the mobile phone service becomes cheaper and cheaper, the increasing customers subscribe to benefit 
 from this service. 

　　As discussed above, it is not surprising to see this change. In my opinion, this trend that the number 
 of mobile-phone subscriptions is increasingly increasing will continue for a while in the future.
