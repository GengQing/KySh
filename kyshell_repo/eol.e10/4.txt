　　over the past decade, many companies had perfected the art of creating automatic behaviors - habits 
 - among consumers. These habits have helped companies earn billions of dollars when customers eat 
 snacks, apply lotions and wipe counters almost without thinking, often in response to a carefully 
 designed set of daily cues. 

　　“There are fundamental public health problems, like hand washing with soap, that remain killers only 
 because we can’t figure out how to change people’s habits,” Dr. Curtis said. “We wanted to learn 
 from private industry how to create new behaviors that happen automatically.” 

　　The companies that Dr. Curtis turned to - Procter & Gamble, Colgate-Palmolive and Unilever - had invested 
 hundreds of millions of dollars finding the subtle cues in consumers’ lives that corporations 
 could use to introduce new routines. 

　　If you look hard enough, you’ll find that many of the products we use every day - chewing gums, skin 
 moisturizers, disinfecting wipes, air fresheners, water purifiers, health snacks, antiperspirants, 
 colognes, teeth whiteners, fabric softeners, vitamins - are results of manufactured habits. A century 
 ago, few people regularly brushed their teeth multiple times a day. Today, because of canny 
 advertising and public health campaigns, many Americans habitually give their pearly whites a cavity-preventing 
 scrub twice a day, often with Colgate, Crest or one of the other brands. 

　　A few decades ago, many people didn’t drink water outside of a meal. Then beverage companies started 
 bottling the production of far-off springs,and now office workers unthinkingly sip bottled water 
 all day long. Chewing gum, once bought primarily by adolescent boys, is now featured in commercials 
 as a breath freshener and teeth cleanser for use after a meal. Skin moisturizers are advertised 
 as part of morning beauty rituals,slipped in between hair brushing and putting on makeup. 

　　“Our products succeed when they become part of daily or weekly patterns,” said Carol Berning, a consumer 
 psychologist who recently retired from Procter & Gamble, the company that sold $76 billion of 
 Tide, Crest and other products last year. “Creating positive habits is a huge part of improving 
 our consumers’ lives, and it’s essential to making new products commercially viable.” 

　　Through experiments and observation, social scientists like Dr. Berning have learned that there is 
 power in tying certain behaviors to habitual cues through relentless advertising. As this new science 
 of habit has emerged, controversies have erupted when the tactics have been used to sell questionable 
 beauty creams or unhealthy foods.
