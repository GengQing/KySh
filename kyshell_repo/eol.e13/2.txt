　　Text 1 

　　In an essay entitled “Making It in America”, the author Adam Davidson relates a joke from cotton about 
 just how much a modern textile mill has been automated: The average mill only two employees today,” 
 a man and a dog. The man is there to feed the dog is there to keep the man away from the machines.” 
 

　　Davidson’s article is one of a number of pieces that have recently appeared making the point that the 
 reason we have such stubbornly high unemployment and declining middle-class incomes today is also 
 because of the advances in both globalization and the information technology revolution, which 
 are more rapidly than ever replacing labor with machines or foreign worker. 

　　In the past, workers with average skills, doing an average job，could earn an average lifestyle ,But 
 ,today ,average is officially over. Being average just won’t earn you what it used to. It can’t when 
 so many more employers have so much more access to so much more above average cheap foreign labor, 
 cheap robotics, cheap software, cheap automation and cheap genius. Therefore, everyone needs 
 to find their extra-their unique value contribution that makes them stand out in whatever is their 
 field of employment. 

　　Yes, new technology has been eating jobs forever, and always will. But there’s been an acceleration. 
 As Davidson notes,” In the 10 years ending in 2009, [U.S.] factories shed workers so fast that they 
 erased almost all the gains of the previous 70 years; roughly one out of every three manufacturing 
 jobs-about 6 million in total -disappeared. 

　　There will always be changed-new jobs, new products, new services. But the one thing we know for sure 
 is that with each advance in globalization and the I.T. revolution, the best jobs will require 
 workers to have more and better education to make themselves above average. 

　　In a world where average is officially over, there are many things we need to do to support employment, 
 but nothing would be more important than passing some kind of G.I.Bill for the 21st century that 
 ensures that every American has access to poet-high school education.
