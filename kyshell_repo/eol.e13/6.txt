　　The hugely popular blog the Skint Foodie chronicles how Tony balances his love of good food with living 
 on benefits. After bills, Tony has ￡60 a week to spend, ￡40 of which goes on food, but 10 years 
 ago he was earning ￡130,000 a I year working in corporate communications and eating at London's 
 best restaurants'" at least twice a week. Then his marriage failed, his career burned out and his 
 drinking became serious. "The community mental health team saved my life. And I felt like that again, 
 to a certain degree, when people responded to the blog so well. It gave me the validation and 
 confidence that I'd lost. But it's still a day-by-day thing." Now he's living in a council flat and 
 fielding offers from literary agents. He's feeling positive, but he'll carry on blogging - not 
 about eating as cheaply as you can - "there are so many people in a much worse state, with barely 
 any money to spend on food" - but eating well on a budget. Here's his advice for economical foodies. 
 

　　41._____________________ 

　　Impulsive spending isn't an option, so plan your week's menu in advance, making shopping lists for 
 your ingredients in their exact quantities. I have an Excel template for a week of breakfast, lunch 
 and dinner. Stop laughing: it's not just cost effective but helps you balance your diet. It's also 
 a good idea to shop daily instead of weekly, because, being-human, you'll sometimes change your 
 mind about what you fancy. 

　　42____________________________________________________________ 

　　This is where supermarkets and their anonymity come in handy. With them, 

　　there's not the same embarrassment as when buying one carrot in a little 

　　greengrocer. And if you plan properly, you'll know that you only need, say, 350g 

　　of shin of beef and six rashers of bacon, not whatever weight is pre-packed in the 

　　supermarket chiller. 

　　43_________ 

　　You may proudly claim to only have frozen peas in the freezer - that's not 

　　good enough. Mine is filled with leftovers, bread, stock, meat and fish. Planning 

　　ahead should eliminate wastage, but if you have surplus vegetables you'll do a 

　　vegetable soup, and all fruits threatening to "go off' will be cooked or juiced. 

　　44___________________________________ 

　　Everyone says this, but it really is a top tip for frugal eaters. Shop at butchers, 

　　delis and fish-sellers regularly, even for small things, and be super friendly. Soon 

　　you'll feel comfortable asking if they've any knuckles of ham for soups and stews, 

　　or beef bones, chicken carcasses and fish heads for stock which, more often than 

　　not, they'll let you have for free. 

　　45__________________ 

　　You won't be eating out a lot, but save your pennies and once every few 

　　months treat yourself to a set lunch at a good restaurant - ￡1.75 a week for three 

　　months gives you ￡21 - more than" enough for a three-course lunch at 

　　Michelin-starred Arbutus. It's ￡16.95 there - or ￡12.99 for a large pizza from 

　　Domino's: I know which I'd rather eat. 

　　Section III Translation

　　Translate the following text from English into Chinese. Write your translation on ANSWER SHEET 2. (15

　　I can pick a date from the past 53 years and know instantly where I was, what happened in the news 
 and even the day of the week, I’ve been able to do this, since I was four. 

　　I never feel overwhelmed with the amount of information my brain absorbs. My mind seems to be able 
 to cope and the information is stored away neatly. When I think of a sad memory, I do what everybody 
 does-try to put it to one side. I don’t think it’s harder for me just because my memory is clearer. 
 Powerful memory doesn’t make my emotions any more acute or vivid. I can recall the day my grandfather 
 died and the sadness I felt when we went to the hospital the day of the week the day of the 
 week day before. I also remember that the musical play Hair opened on Broadway on the same day-they 
 both just pop into my mind in the same way.
