　　Europe is not a gender-equality heaven. In particular, the corporate workplace will never be completely 
 family—friendly until women are part of senior management decisions, and Europe’s top corporate-governance 
 positions remain overwhelmingly male .indeed, women hold only 14 percent of positions 
 on Europe corporate boards. 

　　The Europe Union is now considering legislation to compel corporate boards to maintain a certain proportion 
 of women-up to 60 percent. This proposed mandate was born of frustration. Last year, Europe 
 Commission Vice President Viviane Reding issued a call to voluntary action. Reding invited corporations 
 to sign up for gender balance goal of 40 percent female board membership. But her appeal 
 was considered a failure: only 24 companies took it up. 

　　Do we need quotas to ensure that women can continue to climb the corporate Ladder fairy as they balance 
 work and family? 

　　“Personally, I don’t like quotas,” Reding said recently. “But i like what the quotas do.” Quotas get 
 action: they “open the way to equality and they break through the glass ceiling,” according to Reding, 
 a result seen in France and other countries with legally binding provisions on placing women 
 in top business positions. 

　　I understand Reding’s reluctance-and her frustration. I don’t like quotas either; they run counter 
 to my belief in meritocracy, government by the capable. Bur, when one considers the obstacles to achieving 
 the meritocratic ideal, it does look as if a fairer world must be temporarily ordered. 

　　After all, four decades of evidence has now shown that corporations in Europe as the US are evading 
 the meritocratic hiring and promotion of women to top position— no matter how much “soft pressure 
 ” is put upon them. When women do break through to the summit of corporate power--as, for example, 
 Sheryl Sandberg recently did at Facebook—they attract massive attention precisely because they remain 
 the exception to the rule. 

　　If appropriate pubic policies were in place to help all women---whether CEOs or their children’s caregivers--and 
 all families, Sandberg would be no more newsworthy than any other highly capable person 
 living in a more just society.
