　　Scientists have found that although we are prone to snap overreactions, if we take a moment and think 
 about how we are likely to react, we can reduce or even eliminate the negative effects of our quick, 
 hard-wired responses. 

　　Snap decisions can be important defense mechanisms; if we are judging whether someone is dangerous, 
 our brains and bodies are hard-wired to react very quickly, within milliseconds. But we need more 
 time to assess other factors. To accurately tell whether someone is sociable, studies show, we need 
 at least a minute, preferably five. It takes a while to judge complex aspects of personality, like 
 neuroticism or open-mindedness. 

　　But snap decisions in reaction to rapid stimuli aren’t exclusive to the interpersonal realm. Psychologists 
 at the University of Toronto found that viewing a fast-food logo for just a few milliseconds 
 primes us to read 20 percent faster, even though reading has little to do with eating. We unconsciously 
 associate fast food with speed and impatience and carry those impulses into whatever else 
 we’re doing, Subjects exposed to fast-food flashes also tend to think a musical piece lasts too long. 
 

　　Yet we can reverse such influences. If we know we will overreact to consumer products or housing options 
 when we see a happy face (one reason good sales representatives and real estate agents are always 
 smiling), we can take a moment before buying. If we know female job screeners are more likely 
 to reject attractive female applicants, we can help screeners understand their biases-or hire outside 
 screeners. 

　　John Gottman, the marriage expert, explains that we quickly “thin slice” information reliably only 
 after we ground such snap reactions in “thick sliced” long-term study. When Dr. Gottman really wants 
 to assess whether a couple will stay together, he invites them to his island retreat for a muck 
 longer evaluation; two days, not two seconds. 

　　Our ability to mute our hard-wired reactions by pausing is what differentiates us from animals: doge 
 can think about the future only intermittently or for a few minutes. But historically we have spent 
 about 12 percent of our days contemplating the longer term. Although technology might change the 
 way we react, it hasn’t changed our nature. We still have the imaginative capacity to rise above 
 temptation and reverse the high-speed trend.
