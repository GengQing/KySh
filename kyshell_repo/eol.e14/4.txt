　　1)Crying is hardly an activity encouraged by society. Tears, be they of sorrow, anger, on joy,typically 
 make Americans feel uncomfortable and embarrassed. The shedder of tears is likely to apologize, even 
 when a devastating (毁灭性的) tragedy was the provocation. The observer of tears is likely to do everything 
 possible to putan end to the emotional outpouring. But judging from recent studies of cryingbehavior, 
 links between illness and crying and the chemical composition of tears, both those responses 
 to tears are often inappropriate and may even be counterproductive. 

　　2)Humans are the only animals definitely known to shed emotional tears. Since evolution has given rise 
 to few, if any, purposeless physiological response, it is logical to assume that crying has one or 
 more functions that enhance survival. 

　　3)Although someobservers have suggested that crying is a way to solicit assistance from others(as a crying 
 baby might from its mother), the shedding of tears is hardly necessary to get help. Vocal cries 
 would have been quite enough, more likely than tears to gain attention, So, it appears, there must 
 be something special about tears themselves. 

　　4)Indeed, the newstudies suggest that emotional tears may play a direct role in alleviating stress, University 
 of Minnesota researchers who are studying the chemical composition of tears have recently 
 isolated two important chemicals fromemotional tears. Both chemicals are found only in tears that 
 are shed in response to emotion. Tears shed because of exposure to cut onion would contain no such substance. 
 

　　5)Researchers at several other institutions are investigating the usefulness of tears as a means of diagnosing 
 human ills and monitoring drugs. 

　　6)At Tulane University’sTeat Analysis Laboratory Dr. Peter Kastl and his colleagues report that theycan 
 use tears to detect drug abuse and exposure to medication(药物), to determinewhether a contact lens 
 fits properly of why it may be uncomfortable, to studythe causes of “dry eye” syndrome and the 
 effects of eye surgery, and perhapseven to measure exposure to environmental pollutants. 

　　7)At Columbia UniversityDt. Liasy Faris and colleagues are studying tears for clues to the diagnosis 
 of diseases away from the eyes. Tears can be obtained painlessly without invadingthe body and only 
 tiny amounts are needed to perform highly refined analyses.
