　　An article inScientific America has pointed out that empirical research says that, actually,you think 
 you’re more beautiful than you are. We have a deep-seated need tofeel good about ourselves and 
 we naturally employ a number of self-enhancingstrategies to research into what the call the “above 
 average effect”, or“illusory superiority”, and shown that, for example, 70% of us rate ourselvesas 
 above average in leadership, 93% in driving and 85% at getting on well withothers—all obviously 
 statistical impossibilities. 

　　We rose tint ourmemories and put ourselves into self-affirming situations. We become defensivewhen 
 criticized, and apply negative stereotypes to others to boost our ownesteem, we stalk around thinking 
 we’re hot stuff. 

　　Psychologist andbehavioral scientist Nicholas Epley oversaw a key studying intoself-enhancement and 
 attractiveness. Rather that have people simply rate theirbeauty compress with others, he asked them 
 to identify an original photograghof themselves’ from a lineup including versions that had been 
 altered to appearmore and less attractive. Visual recognition, reads the study, is “an automaticpsychological 
 process occurring rapidly and intuitively with little or no apparentconscious deliberation”. 
 If the subjects quickly chose a falsely flatteringimage- which must did- they genuinely believed 
 it was really how they looked.Epley found no significant gender difference in responses. Nor 
 was there anyevidence that, those who self-enhance the must (that is, the participants whothought 
 the most positively doctored picture were real) were doing so to makeup for profound insecurities. 
 In fact those who thought that the images higherup the attractiveness scale were real directly 
 corresponded with those whoshowed other makers for having higher self-esteem. “I don’t think the findingsthat 
 we having have are any evidence of personal delusion”, says Epley. “It’s areflection simply 
 of people generally thinking well of themselves’. If you aredepressed, you won’t be self-enhancing. 
 Knowing the results of Epley ‘sstudy,it makes sense that why people heat photographs of themselvesViscerally-on 
 one level, they don’t even recognize the person in the picture asthemselves, 
 Face book therefore ,is a self-enhancer’s paradise, where peoplecan share only the most flattering 
 photos, the cream of their wit ,style,beauty, intellect and lifestyle it’s not that people’s profiles 
 are dishonest,says Catalina toma of Wiscon—Madison university ,”but they portray an idealizedversion 
 of themselves.
