　　Most people would define optimism as endlessly happy, with a glass that’s perpetually half fall. But 
 that’s exactly the kind of false deerfulness that positive psychologists wouldn’t recommend. “Healthy 
 optimists means being in touch with reality.” says Tal Ben-Shahar, a Harvard professor, According 
 to Ben- Shalar,realistic optimists are these who make the best of things that happen, but not 
 those who believe everything happens for the best. 

　　Ben-Shalar uses three optimistic exercisers. When he feels down-sag, after giving a bad lecture-he 
 grants himself permission to be human. He reminds himself that mot every lecture can be a Nobel winner; 
 some will be less effective than others. Next is reconstruction, He analyzes the weak lecture, 
 leaning lessons, for the future about what works and what doesn’t. Finally, there is perspective, 
 which involves acknowledging that in the ground scheme of life, one lecture really doesn’t matter.

　　大多数人愿意把乐观定义为无尽的欢乐，就像一只总是装着半杯水的杯子。但那是一种绝不会为积极心理学家所推荐的虚假快乐。哈佛大学的Tal Ben-Shahar教授说，“健康的乐观主义，意味着要处于现实之中。”在Ben-Shahar看来，现实的乐观主义者，会尽最大努力做好一件事，而不是相信每件事都会有最好的结果。 
 

　　Ben-Shahar 会进行三种乐观方面的练习。比如说，当他进行了一次糟糕的演讲，感到心情郁闷的时候，他会告诉自己这是人之常情。他会提醒自己：并不是每一次演讲都可以获得诺贝尔获，总会有一些演讲比其它演讲效果差。接着是重塑，他分析了这个效果不好的演讲，并且从那些起作用和不起作用的演讲中吸取教训为将来做准备。最后，需要有这样一种观点，那就是承认，在广阔的生命当中，一次演讲根本算不上什么。
