 answers on ANSWER SHEET. (40 points) 

　　Text 1 

　　1)What would you do with590m? This is now a question for Gloria Mackenzie, an 84-year-old widow whorecently 
 emerged from her small, tin-roofed house in Florida to collect thebiggest undivided lottery 
 jackpot in history. If she hopes her new-found fortune will yield lasting feelings of fulfillment, 
 she could do worse than readHappy Money by Elizabeth Dumn and Michael Norton. 

　　2)These two academicsuse an array of behavioral research to show that the most rewarding ways tospend 
 money can be counterintuitive. Fantasies of great wealth often involvevisions of fancy cars and extravagant 
 homes. Yet satisfaction with thesematerial purchases wears off fairly quickly what was 
 once exciting and newbecomes old-hat; regret creeps in. It is far better to spend money onexperiences, 
 say Ms Dumn and Mr Norton, like interesting trips, unique meals oreven going to the cinema. These 
 purchases often become more valuable withtime-as stories or memories-particularly if they involve 
 feeling more connectedto others. 

　　3)This slim volume ispacked with tips to help wage slaves as well as lottery winners get the most"happiness 
 bang for your buck." It seems most people would be betteroff if they could shorten their commutes 
 to work, spend more time with friendsand family and less of it watching television (something 
 the average Americanspends a whopping two months a year doing, and is hardly jollier for it).Buyinggifts 
 or giving to charity is often more pleasurable than purchasing things foroneself, and luxuries 
 are most enjoyable when they are consumed sparingly. Thisis apparently the reason MacDonald's 
 restricts the availability of its popularMcRib - a marketing trick that has turned the pork sandwich 
 into an object ofobsession. 

　　4)Readers of “Happy Money”are clearly a privileged lot, anxious about fulfillment, not hunger. Money 
 maynot quite buy happiness, but people in wealthier countries are generallyhappier than those in poor 
 ones. Yet the link between feeling good and spendingmoney on others can be seen among rich and 
 poor people around the world, andscarcity enhances the pleasure of most things for most people. Not 
 everyonewill agree with the authors’ policy ideas, which range from mandating moreholiday time 
 to reducing tax incentives for American homebuyers. But mostpeople will come away from this book believing 
 it was money well spent.
